Identify:1. Sequential code sections2. Conditional branches3. Loops2. Use the tactic S_SEQ (or the custom tactic sapply_s_seq) to isolate these sections.3. These situations might come up:1. Sequential code sections* Use S_SEQ or some custom tactic (e.g. auto_seq)\n      to \"peel off\" the last instruction and inspect\n      it isolatedly. You might have to think of an fitting R.* Use the specification for the isolated instruction to formally verify the\n      correctness of this single step.* Repeat the process2. Conditional branches* Apply S_COND* Show, that Q is valid with1. P \\wedge C2. P \\wedge \\neg C\n      by going through both code sections and repeat from 1.3. Loops* Apply S_LOOP by finding the condition C of the loop, the loop invariant I\n      and the loop variant V as described in the introduction of\n      S-LOOP* Show the formal correctness of the loop body, when the C is true (the condition\n      for one loop iteration is given)* Show, that the loop is left when ¬C (the condition for one loop iteration is not given)\n\nFor some easy examples, have a look into the\nExample file.\nThere you can find how the custom tactics are applied on some small code examples.\n\nAlso, a bigger example can be seen in the file\nOtpProof.\nHere, an implementation of the \"One-Time-Pad\" was formally verified.\nNote, that this example is quite old and should be refactored.\n\n\n","context":"Documentation MRiscX\u0009Process Of Proving The Formal Correctness","header":"4.2.
