window.docContents[72].resolve({"/Limitations/#limitation":{"contents":"This DSL has some limitations, since it is still work in progress.\nAt the moment, it is a simple way to prove the formal correctness of simple,\nsequential code. It can also be used to formally verify the correctness of some\nmore complex code (see\nOtpProof\n). Unfortunately for those proofs it becomes quite messy and you have to have a deep\nunderstanding of Lean itself and how the model MState is implemented.\nAlso, you need to be very familiar with the Hoare-logic.\n\nAdditionally, there are some features missing which are currently implemented or at least on the\nTODO list. This list looks like this at the moment:\n\n* Completion of assembly instructions* As shown in the list of available instructions, several\n    instructions are missing. These will be implemented in future versions.* Remove the space in the register names* As mentioned in the assembly chapter, in the current version is a\n    space required between the x and the number of the register.* Incorporation of calling conventions* Currently, it is possible to modify the contents of register x_0. In RISC-V, however, this\n    register is hard-wired to zero and cannot be changed.* This restriction, along with additional RISC-V calling conventions, should be formally\n    integrated into MRiscX.* Multiple register names* Support for register aliases beyond x_n.* For example, registers such as t_n or a_n should be available.* Proof automation* At present, only the application of the rule S-SEQ is automated. This should be extended to\n    automate the application of additional Hoare rules.* Currently, the tactic apply_spec can be used to apply a specification. However, it still\n    requires manually providing details such as the current program counter location. This process\n    could be further automated, ideally to the point where even the name of the required\n    specification is inferred automatically.* We aim to support multiple levels of proof automation. For instance, users should be able to\n    apply tactics such as sapply_s_seq to follow the verification process step by step, or use\n    more advanced tactics like auto_seq - or even a single high-level tactic - that automatically\n    verifies all steps at once for fast and convenient formal verification of assembly code.\n\n\n","context":"Documentation MRiscX","header":"5.
