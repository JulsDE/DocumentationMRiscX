To apply this rule, a loop condition C,\na loop invariant I and a loop variant V are required.\nThe special feature of I is that it is a statement that is true both before and after each loop\niteration.\nTherefore, I remains valid regardless of the number of loop iterations - even if the loop is not\nexecuted a single time.\nOn the opposite sits the loop variant.\nThe loop variant is an element or statement V from a well-ordered set\nW with < as the order relation.\nDue to the well-ordering, the set W has a smallest element, which means that there cannot\nbe an infinite chain with x_1 > x_2 > \\dots. It now needs to\nbe shown that the value of V decreases strictly monotonically, i.e., it decreases after\neach loop iteration.\nIf this can be shown, the loop must terminate at some point, since the value of V can only\ndecrease a finite number of times.\nFor this proof, the variable x is introduced, which is not used in any other way within a\nprogram.\n\nThis whole concept is formalized in the rule S-LOOP as follows:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\models l \\notin L_W \\\\\n    \\models l \\notin L_B\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\n    \\begin{matrix}\n        [C \\wedge I \\wedge V = x]\n        l \\rightarrow \\langle \\{l\\} \\cup L_W | L_B \\rangle\n        [\\textrm{\\textbf{lbl}} = l \\wedge I \\wedge V < x] \\\\\n\n        [\\neg C \\wedge I]l \\rightarrow \\langle L_W | L_B \\rangle [Q]\n    \\end{matrix}\n    }\n    {[I]l \\rightarrow \\langle L_W | L_B\\rangle [Q]}\n    \\quad \\textrm{\\scriptsize S-LOOP}\n\n\nA rule to verify the formal correctness of a loop.\nRequires:* A Condition C* An Invariant I* A Variant VFor more information, see the (documentation)[TODO insert link]\n\nThe rule S-LOOP describes two states of a loop.\nOn the one hand, there is the loop itself, which is bound to condition C and contains both the\nloop invariant I and the loop variant V. The union of \\{l\\} and L_W and the\npostcondition \\mathbf{lbl} = l ensure that at the end of a loop iteration, the PC points back\nto the beginning of the loop.\nOn the other hand, there is the case where \\neg C applies. Under these circumstances,\nthe loop body is exited, and a jump is made to one of the lines stored in L_W.\n\n","context":"Documentation MRiscX\u0009Fundamentals\u0009Hoare-Rules","header":"2.4.5.
