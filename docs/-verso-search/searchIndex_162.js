A Hoare-triple\nis a statement about the state of a machine before and after the execution\nof a command. By default, such a triple is noted as follows:\n\n\n\\{P\\} c \\{Q\\}\n\n\nP and Q are logical statements about the state before and after the\nexecution of the program segment c.\nWhat exactly these statements describe depends on the structure of the\nrespective machine state.\nFor example, they may refer to variable assignments, the contents of memory,\nregister values, or the value of the program counter.\nThe Hoare-triple now states:\n\nIf command c begins execution in a state that satisfies statement P,\nand if c eventually terminates in a state, then that final state satisfies\nstatement Q.\nThe statement P is called the  precondition of the\ntriple, and Q is the\n postcondition.\n\nExample:\n\n{x = 0} x := x + 1 {x = 1}\n\n\nThis Hoare-triple states:\nIf there is a state in which x=0 applies, and then the code x := x + 1\nis executed, then x = 1 applies afterwards.\n\n","context":"Documentation MRiscX\u0009Fundamentals\u0009Hoare-Logic","header":"2.2.1.
